<blockquote>
    <p><em>“The greatest impact of the Kids First program may be in its development of a collaborative network of scientists, clinicians, patients, and their families who are working together to determine shared genetic etiologies for pediatric birth defects and cancers. This exciting, integrative approach holds promise for rapid genetic advances that will quickly influence diagnostic and therapeutic interventions for affected children everywhere.”</em> - Dr. Elizabeth Engle</p>

Elizabeth Engle's research on congenital cranial dysinnervation disorders (CCDDs) has brought to light the genetics and fundamental mechanisms behind cranial nerve development and function. Engle and her team have used family cohorts and model organisms to investigate the expression of genes, wiring of neural circuits, and response of neurons to growth signals in the context of these disorders. Her current work to understand cranial axon guidance and connectivity may also inform research on human cognitive disorders such as schizophrenia, autism, dyslexia, and depression.
