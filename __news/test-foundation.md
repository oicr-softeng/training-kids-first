Eleanor Feingold received her PhD in statistics from Stanford University. She has spent her career developing new computational methods for studying large genomic datasets to find genes that increase risk for a number of different conditions. In Kids First she is working on cleft lip and palate, but she has also worked on Alzheimer’s, Down syndrome, and heart defects. The goal of all of these studies is to understand the risk factors better so that families can make the best decisions for themselves and their children.
