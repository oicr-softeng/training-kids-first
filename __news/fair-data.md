    <p>FAIR Data Principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)</p>
</blockquote>

Today, there is a great need to support and partner with the FAIR data principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) due to the big data initiatives needed to identify new precision medicine treatments. Creating standards for data will ensure the outcomes can be leveraged expeditiously in collaborative efforts with the main driving goal to improve healthcare.   

All data stored in the Kids First Data Resource Center aligns with FAIR data principles and procedures (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). The Kids First Data Resource Center is integrated initiative of the NIH Data Commons and supports the National Institutes of Health's mandate for a empowered data stewardship and secondary use of research data that maximizes and accelerates data use, access, and shared discovery while ensuring all core NIH standards & established data use and security policies are fully met.
