    <p><em>“Our organization has run a natural history database for 20 years that we pieced together with blood, sweat, and tears. These researchers have done the same. How incredible it would be to have everyone on the same platform, using the Kids First Data Resource Portal, to push research data further, faster, and maintain ownership, privacy, and patient trust. A resource like the Kids First DRC has been a long time coming, and we are very excited to be on board.”</em> - Dawn Ireland, President</p>
