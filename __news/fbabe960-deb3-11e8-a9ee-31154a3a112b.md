The NIH Common Fund’s <a href="https://commonfund.nih.gov/kidsfirst"> Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program (Kids First) </a>    is proud to announce that whole genome sequence (WGS) data for the “Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS)” project (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs001410.v1.p1">Accession Number: phs001410.v1.p1</a>) is now available to the biomedical research community. 

AIS is a developmental defect of the spine and is the most common pediatric musculoskeletal defect. The goal of the <a href="https://commonfund.nih.gov/kidsfirst/x01projects#Rios16">project, </a> led by Drs. Jonathan Rios and Carol Wise, is to perform WGS to identify genetic causes of AIS.
