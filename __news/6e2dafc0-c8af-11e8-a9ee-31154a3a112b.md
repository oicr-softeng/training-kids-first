The Kids First Data Resource Center is pleased to announce that whole genome sequence (WGS) data for the <a href="https://commonfund.nih.gov/kidsfirst/x01projects#Rios16">“Genomics of Orthopaedic Disease Program” </a> project (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs001247.v1.p1">Accession Number: phs001247.v1.p1 </a>) is now available to the biomedical research community. 

At Texas Scottish Rite Hospital for Children, the Genomics Of Orthopaedic Disease (GOOD for Kids) program seeks to understand pediatric birth defects, such as adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), through close interaction and collaboration with orthopaedic surgeons and treating physicians. AIS is a debilitating curvature and rotational deformity of the spine and is the most common pediatric musculoskeletal deformity in the world. Led by Jonathan Rios, PhD, the program performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS), the most comprehensive approach to identify genetic causes of pediatric disease, using a multi-tiered approach. 

To search, access, and analyze this dataset, apply for access through <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs001228.v1.p1">NIH’s Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP)</a>. Once approved, a user will receive instructions from dbGaP on how to access the data housed by the Kids First Data Resource Center (DRC). For help with this dataset, you may contact support@kidsfirstdrc.org.
