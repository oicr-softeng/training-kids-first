Kids First Data Resource Center Principal Investigator, Adam Resnick, PhD, presented updates from the development of the new Kids First DRC website and portal at the International Symposium on Pediatric Neuro-Oncology (ISPNO 2018) in Denver, Colorado, to an audience of some of the worldâ€™s most renowned pediatric researchers and clinicians. ISPNO is the major, biennial, global meeting of the multidisciplinary community of professionals involved in the scientific research, diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation of infants, children and young people with CNS tumors. Data from the <a href="https://cbttc.org/">Children's Brain Tumor Tissue Consortium</a> comprised the first datasets to be added into the Kids First Data Resource Center, which empower researchers across the globe to discover more effective therapies for children diagnosed with brain tumors.
