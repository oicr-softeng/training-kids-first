<blockquote>
    <p><em>“The [Gabriella Miller] Kids First Data Resource Center is important to Ear Community to educate and promote public awareness about rare conditions such as microtia and atresia, a rare congenital birth defect where the outer ears and ear canals do not fully develop during the first trimester of pregnancy, resulting in missing ears, hearing loss, and craniofacial challenges. The DRC allows the public and families of loved ones who are affected to realize that they are not alone and connects them with helpful resources. Without the help of the Kids First Data Resource Center, education and information about causes like microtia and atresia may never be given the chance to be recognized. The Kids First Data Resource Center can help bring awareness to causes and provide helpful information about potential research opportunities and studies such as clinical trials." </em> - Ear Community</p>
