The Kids First Pediatric Research Program performs whole genome sequencing (WGS) on representative childhood cancer and structural birth defects projects and makes the data available on the Kids First Data Resource Portal for collaborative research. These disease areas will allow scientists to investigate the underlying biology of these conditions and explore if shared genetic pathways exist between genetic disease types. The Kids First program will call for applications to support whole genome sequencing (WGS) of additional childhood cancer and structural birth defect disease areas in fiscal year 2019, pending availability of funds. Additional disease areas may be added by donating data or through investigator-specific awards. Below is the full list of current disease areas:

-   Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis
-   Cancer Susceptibility
-   Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia
-   Craniofacial Microsomia
-   Disorders of Sex Development
-   Enchondromatosis
-   Ewing Sarcoma
-   Familial Leukemia
-   Hearing Loss
-   Infantile Hemangiomas
-   Neuroblastomas
-   Nonsyndromic Craniosynostosis
-   Orofacial Clefts
-   Osteosarcoma
-   Patients with both childhood cancer and birth defects
-   Structural Heart & Other Defects
-   Syndromic Cranial Dysinnervation Disorders
-   Pediatric Brain Tumors
