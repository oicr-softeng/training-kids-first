The Kids First Data Resource Center is pleased to announce that whole genome sequence data for the <a href="https://commonfund.nih.gov/kidsfirst/X01Projects#Schiffman">“Genetic Contribution to Ewing Sarcoma in 330 parent-Offspring Trios” </a> project (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs001228.v1.p1">Accession Number: phs001228 </a>) is now available to the biomedical research community. 

Ewing Sarcoma (ES) is a pediatric bone cancer that occurs in children and adolescents. This project, led by Dr. Joshua Schiffman of the University of Utah, was selected for sequencing in 2015 and will help us understand the genetic basis of ES. Furthermore, this cohort was selected for additional sequencing in 2017, and those data will be made available in the future.

To search, access, and analyze this dataset, apply for access through <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs001228.v1.p1">NIH’s Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP)</a>. Once approved, a user will receive instructions from dbGaP on how to access the data housed by the Kids First Data Resource Center (DRC). For help with this dataset, you may contact support@kidsfirstdrc.org.
