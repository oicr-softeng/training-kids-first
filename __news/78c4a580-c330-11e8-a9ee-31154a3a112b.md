<blockquote>
    <p><em>”The Kids First Data Resource Center is a tremendous resource that enables researchers, health care providers, and families the ability to collaborate and share critical information with each other. Philly Phaces is proud to partner with the Kids First Data Resource Center to better affect the outcome and care provided to our communities.”</em> - Philly Phaces</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><em>”The Kids First Data Resource Center is important to CCA Kids because we know that researchers and care providers having access to accurate information about our kids’ diseases means better outcomes in the long run for them, and better care in the near term for our families. When you are faced with a rare condition, information and ideas are critical to feeling empowered as a patient and caregiver. If our medical professionals collaborate, they can pass on strategies and tactics for improving outcomes to our families and that is why this project is so important! Helping families access quality care is one of our three main goals at CCA Kids.”</em> - Children’s Craniofacial Association</p>
