Illumina, a developer, manufacturer, and marketer of life science tools and integrated systems for large-scale analysis of genetic variation and function, has committed to support the pediatric rare genetic disease community by making data available through ClinVar. Additionally, Illumina will explore support for disease-specific sequencing pilot projects focused on the translation and implementation of clinical whole-genome sequencing in the context of rare disease biospecimens, especially early-onset cancers.
