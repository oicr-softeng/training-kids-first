The overall goal of my laboratory is to understand the genetic basis of inherited susceptibility to cancer. At a basic level, we are interested in studying genes that normally control genomic stability and when disrupted lead to the instability seen in cancer cells including chromosome losses and gains or aneuploidy. Disruption of these control mechanisms have been found in a large percentage of human tumors and in individuals with a predisposition to specific cancers.
