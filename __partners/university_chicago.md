The Center for Data Intensive Science at the University of Chicago is a research center pioneering translational data science to advance biology, medicine, and environmental research. Our work centers around developing instruments to integrate commons of complex data with cloud computing technology. We architect large scale commons of research data, computing resources, applications, tools, services.  Through this approach, we can more effectively use data at scale to study and pursue scientific inquiry in the areas of biology, medicine, healthcare, and the environment.
