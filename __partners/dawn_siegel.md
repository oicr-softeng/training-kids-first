Dr. Siegel is a founding member and scientific co-chairman for the Pediatric Dermatology Research Alliance (PeDRA) to promote and discover better treatments for the pediatric dermatology conditions through research. In addition to practice of common pediatric dermatology conditions, Dr. Siegel also has an expertise in genetic skin syndromes.
