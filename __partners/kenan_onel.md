Dr. Kenan Onel is an expert in cancer genetics and cancer biology. His research is aimed at identifying and studying functionally the genetic basis of cancer susceptibility by identifying genes and genetic markers that alter cancer risk in both inherited and sporadic cancers.  His work is largely directed towards developing studies minimizing inter-individual heterogeneity in order to improve the detection of genetic risk variants with large effects and gene x exposure interactions.  By understanding the genetic contribution to cancer in the context of exposures, he is then able to perform hypothesis-driven laboratory studies to investigate the role of these variants.
