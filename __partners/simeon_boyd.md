Dr. Simeon Boyadjiev Boyd is a pediatrician and board certified clinical geneticist with extensive experience as a clinical and molecular dysmorphologist. He currently holds an appointment as a tenured Professor in the Section of Genetics, Department of Pediatrics at the University of California, Davis. Between 2006 and 2011 he served as a founding chief of the Section of Genetics at UC Davis and was the first holder of the Children’s Miracle Network Endowed Chair in pediatric genetics. Dr. Boyd served as Vice president and President-elect of the Society of Craniofacial Genetics from 2000 to 2004. In 2012 he helped organize and is the current geneticist of a multidisciplinary “Plagiocephaly Clinic” at UC Davis with involvement of neuro-surgeons, neuro-radiologists, plastic and ENT surgeons, and child psychologists. This clinic provides one stop comprehensive evaluations for children with craniosynostosis and related skull defects from Northern and Central California.Since 1998 Dr. Boyd has been continuously funded by grants through NIDCR-NIH. With these resources he initiated the International Craniosynostosis Consortium (ICC), a group of scientists and clinicians with special expertise in the field of craniosynostosis. ICC currently coordinates the work of more than 10 sites in US and 6 international sites [https://myhs.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/web/dr.-boyd-s-lab/home](https://myhs.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/web/dr.-boyd-s-lab/home) and has recruited more than 1,500 affected families. Dr. Boyd’s group performed the first Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) of 130 families with non-syndromic sagittal craniosynostosis and identified BMP2 and BBS9 as genes involved in the causation for this birth defect. Recently, a similar GWAS study of 400 families with non-syndromic metopic craniosynostosis was completed and several other strong candidate genes were detected and are being currently evaluated. 
Dr. Boyd’s experience in the area of craniosynostosis and other birth defects, genetic syndromes and disorders is documented by more than 60 peer-reviewed publications available for review at [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=boyadjiev+sa](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=boyadjiev+sa).
