Eleanor Feingold received her Ph.D. in statistics from Stanford University. She has spent her career developing new computational methods for studying large genomic datasets to find genes that increase
 the risk for a number of different conditions. In Kids First, she is working on cleft lip and palate, but she has also worked on Alzheimerâ€™s, Down syndrome, and  heart defects. The goal of all of these studies is to understand the risk factors better so that families can make the best decisions for themselves and their children.
