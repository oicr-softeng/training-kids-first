Elizabeth Engleâ€™s research on congenital cranial dysinnervation disorders (CCDDs) has brought to light details of the genetics and fundamental mechanisms behind cranial nerve development and function. Engle and her team have used family cohorts and model organisms to investigate the expression of genes, wiring of neural circuits, and response of neurons to growth signals in the context of these disorders. Her current work to understand cranial axon guidance and connectivity may inform research on human cognitive disorders such as schizophrenia, autism, dyslexia, and depression.
