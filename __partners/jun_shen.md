Jun is a Clinical Molecular Geneticist certified by the American Board of Medical Genetics and Genomics. She received her B.A. in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology / Computer Science from Dartmouth College in 1998 and a Ph.D. in Neurobiology (genetics) from Harvard University in 2005. She joined the Department of Pathology, Brigham and Womenâ€™s Hospital, Harvard Medical School as an Instructor in 2013 and was promoted to the rank of Assistant Professor in 2016.

Her research is focused on identifying the genetic etiology of hearing loss and developing innovative approaches to diagnosis, prevention and treatment of the condition. Her Ph.D. research with Dr. Christopher A. Walsh at Harvard Medical School involved identifying genes for hereditary neurological disorders using modern genome-wide analysis tools, and her postdoctoral research with Dr. David P. Corey at Harvard Medical School focused on genome-wide analyses of cell-type-specific gene expression in the inner ear.

Jun serves as the Assistant Laboratory Director of the Laboratory for Molecular Medicine, Partners HealthCare Personalized Medicine. She is the creator/co-creator (?) and Administrator of the publicly-accessible Shared Harvard Inner Ear Laboratory Database (SHIELD), where she applies her bioinformatics skills to facilitate variant interpretation and gene discovery for hearing loss. She participates as an international collaborator in the Hearing and Sight Domain of the Genomics England Clinical Interpretation Partnership (GeCIP) and is a member of the ClinGen Expert Panel for Hearing Loss
