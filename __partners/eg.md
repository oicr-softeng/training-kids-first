Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a secure, cloud services platform, offering compute power, database storage, content delivery and other functionality to help businesses scale and grow. AWS has committed their support on behalf of DRC project initiatives, including up to $300,000 in AWS credits under the AWS Cloud Credits for Research Program over a maximum 3-year term; marketing opportunities which may include article releases, webinars/podcasts, and other conference speaking engagements aimed at bringing attention to DRC research and development accomplishments to educate the broader scientific and research cloud computing community; and standard project support from AWS Solutions Architect in ECS/ECR DevOps area.

The awarded credits support researchers who seek to build cloud-hosted, publicly available, science-as-a-service applications, software, or tools to facilitate their future research and the research of their community; perform proof of concept or benchmark tests evaluating the efficacy of moving research workloads or open data sets to the cloud; and/or train a broader community on the usage of cloud for research workloads via workshops or tutorials. -->
