As the nation’s first insurance provider to make next-generation whole genome sequencing and proteomic diagnostics available to their members, Independence Blue Cross (IBX) has identified the DRC’s efforts as an ideal platform for their interactions and collaborations on data-driven discovery and diagnostics on behalf of children.  IBX will continue to provide coverage for clinical  WGS/RNA sequencing and quantitative protein analysis for patients of the six participating hospitals of the Philadelphia Coalition for a Cure (PC4C) with data deposition in the Kids First DRC and CAVATICA.
