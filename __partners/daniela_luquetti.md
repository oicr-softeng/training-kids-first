She completed her medical geneticist training in 2005 and her PhD in Public Health in 2009. Dr. Luquetti's research focuses on the genetic and non-genetic risk factors of craniofacial conditions. Dr. Luquetti has a broad background in medical genetics and epidemiology, with specific training and experience in birth defects. As a doctorate student, she conducted birth defects surveillance research and data analysis on epidemiological aspects of birth defects. In her postdoctoral fellowship in the Division of Craniofacial Medicine at the University of Washington, she expanded her research to include the assessment of genetic sequence variation as well as other potential genetic causes of birth defects. She is currently studying genetic and non-genetic risk factors for microtia (underdevelopment of the external ear) and craniofacial microsomia.     Carrie L Heike, MD, MS is an associate professor Department of Pediatrics at the University of Washington School of Medicine. She serves as a pediatrician for children with craniofacial conditions at the Seattle Childrenâ€™s Craniofacial Center, and conducts research in outcomes of craniofacial care. Drs.
