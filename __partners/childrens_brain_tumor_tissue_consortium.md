The Children’s Brain Tumor Tissue Consortium is a collaborative pediatric brain tumor research program with 15 member institutions located in Europe, Asia and throughout the United States. In support of the Kids First Data Resource Center, the CBTTC  has committed to share all of its highly-robust, clinically-annotated pediatric brain tumor genomic data through CAVATICA, and will support data integration with Kids First data sets to allow for research discoveries by investigators across the world, both within and outside of the DRC.
