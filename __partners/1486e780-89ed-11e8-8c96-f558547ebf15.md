Cynthia Casson Morton is the William Lambert Richardson Professor of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Biology and Professor of Pathology at Harvard Medical School, and the Kenneth J. Ryan, M.D. Distinguished Chair in Obstetrics and Gynecology and Director of Cytogenetics at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.  She received her Bachelor’s of Science degree from the College of William and Mary in Virginia and her Ph.D. in Human Genetics from the Medical College of Virginia in Richmond.  She is certified by the American Board of Medical Genetics in Ph.D. Medical Genetics, Clinical Cytogenetics and Clinical Molecular Genetics.  As a human geneticist, Dr. Morton is interested in studying the genetic causes of hearing loss, uterine fibroids and birth defects so that new understanding of the biology of the disorders may be gained and new treatments developed.  She also is beginning a new study based at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and at the University of Manchester, UK called SEQaBOO (SEQuencing a Baby for an Optimal Outcome).  These programs will integrate genomic sequencing into newborn screening for babies who fail their newborn hearing screening tests and evaluate the clinical utility of genomic testing in the care of babies born with heritable hearing loss.
