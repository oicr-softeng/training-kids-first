Dr. Butali joined the College of Dentistry in 2013 after completing his postdoctoral fellowship in craniofacial genetics at the University of Iowa. Dr. Butali directs the African Craniofacial Anomalies Network, a collaboration between scientists in Ghana, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, and Rwanda. His research, "Genetic Studies of Non-syndromic Clefts in Populations of African Descent," is currently funded through a K99/R00 award from the National Institute for Dental and Craniofacial Research. His studies use a variety of techniques and approaches, including next generation sequencing approaches. He is also involved in the investigation of subclinical phenotypes for orofacial clefts as well as examining the role of micronutrients in oral clefts prevention. Other interests include genetics of aggressive periodontitis and genetics of preterm births in the African population. He is currently collaborating with researchers in Nigeria, Ghana, Ethiopia, South Africa, Rwanda, Kenya, Dundee (Scotland), Seattle (WA), Pittsburgh (PA), and Puerto Rico.
