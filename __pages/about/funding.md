  The National Institutes of Health Common Fund's Gabriella Miller Kids First
  Pediatric Research Program recently announced the award to establish the DRC.
  Contingent on available funds, the award is expected to provide funding for
  five years of up to a total of approximately $14.8 million. Within the NIH,
  the Kids First program is primarily led by four Institutes and Centers (ICs)
  -- the [*Eunice Kennedy Shriver* National Institute of Child Health and Human
  Development (NICHD)](https://www.nichd.nih.gov/), the [National Cancer
  Institute (NCI)](https://www.cancer.gov/'), the [National Human Genome
  Research Institute (NHGRI)](http://www.genome.gov/) and the [National Heart,
  Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI)](http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/), in partnership
  with the [Office of the NIH
  Director](https://www.nih.gov/institutes-nih/nih-office-director) and with
  additional involvement of several other key NIH Institutes and Centers.


  The [Gabriella Miller Kids First Research
  Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/2019/text?q=%7b%22search%22%3A%5b%22%5C%22hr2019%5C%22%22%5d%7d&resultIndex=2)
  was established in April 2014, less than six months after 10-year-old
  Gabriella Miller, an advocate for childhood cancer research, died from an
  inoperable brain tumor. Her efforts to raise awareness of childhood cancer
  raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for children's cancer charities. 
  Congress passed the Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act to direct funding
  into the NIH Common Fund over a 10-year period in support of pediatric
  research.


  The Kids First Data Resource Center and it's website (kidsfirstdrc.org) are
  supported by the NIH Common Fund under Award Number U2CHL138346, which is
  administered by the National Heart, Lung, And Blood Institute of the National
  Institutes of Health. The content is solely the responsibility of the authors
