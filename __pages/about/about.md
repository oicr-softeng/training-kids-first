leftContent_txt: >-
  The Kids First Data Resource Center is a new, collaborative, pediatric
  research effort with the goal of understanding the genetic causes of and links
  between childhood cancer and structural birth defects.


  As part of the [Common Fund’s Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research
  Program](https://commonfund.nih.gov/kidsfirst), the Kids First Data Resource
  Center (DRC) is charged with:

rightContent_txt: >-
  While improved technologies and genome sequencing efforts have transformed
  diagnostic and precision medicine approaches in healthcare, childhood cancer
  and birth defects can be challenging to study due to the limited amounts of
  patient samples available in any one institution.


  The Kids First Data Resource Center (DRC) is a collaborative pediatric
  research effort created to accelerate data-driven discoveries and the
  development of novel precision-based approaches for children diagnosed with
  cancer or a structural birth defect using large genomic datasets. The DRC is
  comprised of integrated core teams that support development of leading-edge
  big data infrastructure and provide the necessary resources and tools to 
  empower researchers and clinicians. Additionally, the DRC will connect
  patients, families, and foundations with the researchers studying specific
  disease areas.


  The DRC's **expert doctors, scientists, and researchers work together with
  patient families** to understand the underlying causes of these diseases in
  children on a biological level and to ultimately support the development of
  improved and targeted treatments.

  The Data Resource Center mission is accomplished through strategic
  implementation of three multidisciplinary Cores with the following focus
  areas:

  - core_txt: >-
      The [Data Resource Portal (DRP)](/portal/) provides a cloud-based,
      collaborative workspace and computational infrastructure, where data and
      analysis tools are readily accessible to the world-wide research
      community. Additionally, the DRP enables researchers to instantly search
      large genomic and clinical datasets using new data visualization tools,
      cloud-based workspace environments, and data-sharing platforms.

      The Data Coordination Center (DCC) manages the curation of genomic and
      clinical data contributed by Kids First Program researchers and ensures
      that data collected from different disease types can be brought together
      into one common format. The Data Coordination Center collaborates with the
      University of Chicago's Bionimbus, which is a [National Institutes of
      Health (NIH) Trusted 
      Partner](https://osp.od.nih.gov/scientific-sharing/data-repositories-and-trusted-partners/),
      to ensure data management, access, and use meet all required core NIH
      standards & established data quality, security, and service protocols.

      The Administrative & Outreach Core (AOC) coordinates research activities
      and communications across the DRC's partnered research landscape and
      engages the research community, including researchers, physicians, and
      patient and foundation advocates.
