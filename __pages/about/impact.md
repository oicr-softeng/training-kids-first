  By the end of 2018 more than 25,000 patient samples will be available for
  sequencing and analysis, making Kids First the largest pediatric genomic
  datasets of its kind
leftContentTitle_txt: Why Establish a Data Resource Center?
leftContentParagraph_txt: >-
  Historically, genomic data was analyzed and stored in individual
  investigators' local computing environments.  The volume of genomic data
  generated by Kids First, however, often exceeds local genomic data
  storage/analysis solutions traditionally practiced in academic research and
  requires new technologies, resources, and user-specific environments to be
  able to store, access, compute, integrate, and share data. The DRC resolves
  the following issues related to scaling genomic data including:
leftContent_list:
  - item_txt: >-
      **Moving large amounts of data** from one location to another is costly
      and time-consuming.
  - item_txt: >-
      Only a few academic and commercial institutions are **capable of
      efficiently storing and computing across such large-scale genomic data**
      limiting the required diverse and multidisciplinary input required to
      advance research rapidly.
  - item_txt: >-
      **Data becomes siloed** and cannot be easily integrated across diseases or
      shared with and accessed by external collaborators, resulting in
      duplication of efforts .

  - title_txt: Kids First Makes Collaboration Possible
    paragraph_txt: >-
      The DRC makes data generated by Kids First accessible to both the research
      and patient communities. Researchers will be able to easily
      combine/compare datasets for cross-dataset analyses to identify the
      genetic pathways that underlie childhood cancer and structural birth
      defects.

  - title_txt: FAIR Data
    content_txt: >-
      All data stored within the Kids First Data Resource Center aligns with
      FAIR data principles and procedures (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable,
      Reusable). The Kids First Data Resource Center is an integrated initiative
      of the NIH Data Commons and supports the National Institutes of Health's
      mandate for a empowered data stewardship and secondary use of research
      data that maximizes and accelerates data use, access, and shared discovery
      while ensuring  all core NIH standards & established data use and security
      policies are fully met.

  - title_txt: Benefits of Data Sharing
    leftParagraph_txt: >-
      The Kids First DRC is committed to providing secure, transparent, and
      convenient data access to empower discoveries by researchers and
      clinicians across the globe. Sharing data in a cloud-based portal allows
      the data shared by patient families to contribute to the improved care and
      treatment of other children diagnosed with cancer or structural birth
      defects. This network of information also allows researchers to share best
      practices and methods for treating patients. Data sharing within the Kids
      First DRC will accelerate research and may lead to the development of more
      effective treatments for all children diagnosed with a genetic disease.
    rightParagraph_txt: >-
      The DRC is available to researchers from across the entire biomedical
      research community to access Kids First data and uncover new insights into
      the biology of childhood cancer and structural birth defects or to develop
      new computational methods for analyzing genetic data. The Kids First Data
      Resource will also be available for researchers to use in their own
      studies supported by other public and private funding sources.
