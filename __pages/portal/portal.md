    paragraph_txt: >
      ***There are currently limited resources for researchers studying the
      underlying genetics of pediatric diseases.*** Cancer and birth defects
      represent a landscape of highly complex and poorly understood diseases.
      While there is already a healthy web-based research ecosystem for adult
      cancer genomics data there is no comprehensive portal for pediatric
      cancers. Additionally, there are few web- or application-based tools to
      assist researchers investigating the causes and consequences of structural
      birth defects, and no online resources that combine the phenotypic and
      genotype information for these two classes of pediatric disease. This is
      despite abundant evidence that structural birth defects and pediatrics
      cancers share common causation and biological pathways including such
      relatively common syndromes as Down, Klinefelter, Wiskott-Aldrich, Noonan,
      and Perlman, are associated with elevated cancer risk.

      The Kids First Data Resource Portal brings together the childhood cancer
      and structural birth defect research communities, providing a unique
      combination of large-scale integrated data resources and scalable
      cloud-based computation for researchers to leverage the information
      gathered by one community to acquire insights in the other, and to
      recognize and promote collaborations among the two disciplines and across
      diverse expertise.

  The portal brings together a diverse group of patients, researchers, and
  clinicians, partnering together to create the largest database of pediatric
  genomic data and provides the necessary tools and computational resources for
  analysis and interpretation of these complex data. This information will be
  used to advance personalized medicine for the detection, therapy, and the
  management of childhood cancer and structural birth defects.
