      The Kids First Program generates high-quality whole genome sequence data,
      and whole exome and transcriptome for tumors/affected tissue along with
      related clinical data, to discover genetic variants that contribute to
      pediatric conditions. Making this data as accessible as possible to the
      research community enables researchers to easily combine/compare datasets
      for cross-dataset analyses.  For Germline or Normal  samples WGS is
      supported at 30X coverage and for Tumor or Affected tissue [[Whole Genome
      Sequencing]]((**Whole Genome Sequencing** is the process of determining
      the complete DNA sequence of an organism's genome at a single time.)) is
      supported at 30X coverage in addition to 100X for whole exome sequencing
      and 100X for RNAseq.
