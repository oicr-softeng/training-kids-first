      The data in the Kids First Data Resource Portal is a collection of
      datasets from various investigators who are performing disease-specific
      research. Each of these datasets originally formed a research study before
      being deposited into the Portal. The idea behind these many
      studies/datasets coming together in one location is for other
      investigators to come in and create new studies and research based on the
      data already curated. Information on the studies/datasets that are in the
      Data Resource Portal can be found on the [Study Updates
      page](/news/#/?&filter=studies&order=desc) and the [NIH X01 Study
      Page](https://commonfund.nih.gov/kidsfirst/X01Projects). 


      The following disease areas have been selected during 2015, 2016, 2017 and
      2018 and will be available on the portal as the datasets are made
      available. Additional disease areas will be included through the donation
      of data and subsequent Kids First Investigator Awards.

      The studies in the data resource portal comprise of genomic sequencing and
      phenotype data from participants. Study Participants are de identified
      pediatric patients and their families (mother, father, brother, sister,
      etc)  who consented to allowing their data to be contributed to the study.
      Researchers can search on complete trios in the Portal - which comprise of
      the affected child’s data plus two of their family members. Being able to
      analyze data from multiple members in a family of an affected patient can
      help scientists better understand the diseases.

samples_list:
  - title_txt: Samples
    subtitle_txt: >-
      Study participants consent to samples being taken during various clinical
      visits and surgical procedures. These samples, in-turn, are cultivated and
      sent to the sequencing centers to be genomically sequenced. Samples are
      from various tissue types including blood, saliva, tumor, and buccal
      mucosa (from cheek swabs). Users of the portal can filter their search
      results on the various sample types.
files_list:
  - title_txt: Files
    subtitle_txt: >-
      The end products of genomic sequencing and processing is data files of
      various types. The Portal has various different file types for its
      samples. The common file types are BAMs, CRAMs, and gVCFs. The Data
      Resource Center receives source files from the sequencing center. Because
      the data comes from different sequencing centers with their own workflows,
      we re-process the files to create a harmonized view of the data, which, in
      turn, creates more files; this is why users will see multiple files
      associated with a sample.
size_list:
  - title_txt: Size
    subtitle_txt: >-
      Genomic data files are large! A single file in the portal is anywhere
      between 800 MB and 100 GB. As a reference point, the average size of a
      song in mp3 format is 3.5 MB. This large amount of data is why the Data
      Resource Center values cloud-based resources.
