    content_txt: "The File Repository is the primary method of searching for and accessing data in the Kids First Data Portal. It provides an overview of all participants, biospecimens, associated phenotypic and clinical data, and available genomic data. Kids First offers users a variety of filters for identifying and browsing the rich datasets. More complex facet searching is also available to apply detailed criteria in order to build and an examine a custom cohort. Queries can be saved to a user’s profile for later reference or even shared on social media to collaborate with the research community. Once the appropriate dbGaP approvals have been obtained, users can push the genomic data to Cavatica, Kids First’s cloud-based analytics environment or download the data directly from the File Repository.
