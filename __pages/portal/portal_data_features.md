      Data provided through the Kids First Data Resource Portal is per our
      ideals & strategy surrounding data sharing, the portal strives to make
      data as accessible as possible. With that, access has been bucketed into
      three tiers:

  - title_txt: Open Access Tier
    content_txt: >-
      The Open Access Tier is accessible by all visitors to the Kids First DRC
      website and provides  summary counts of the data available in the Kids
      First Data Resource Portal.
  - title_txt: Registered Access Tier
    content_txt: >-
      The Kids First Tier is available to the public, and anyone can register
      with one of our authentication partners. This will provide secure access
      to the Portal while still making it available to everyone. 
  - title_txt: Controlled Access Tier
    content_txt: >-
      The Controlled Access Tier requires appropriate data access committee
      approval to allow users to view and use data in accordance with NIH
      guidelines.

      The File Repository is the primary method of searching for and accessing
      data in the Kids First Data Portal. It provides an overview of all
      participants, biospecimens, associated phenotypic and clinical data, and
      available genomic data. Kids First offers users a variety of filters for
      identifying and browsing the rich datasets. More complex facet searching
      is also available to apply detailed criteria in order to build and an
      examine a custom cohort. Queries can be saved to a user’s profile for
      later reference or even shared on social media to collaborate with the
      research community. Once the appropriate dbGaP approvals have been
      obtained, users can push the genomic data to Cavatica, Kids First’s
      cloud-based analytics environment or download the data directly from the
      File Repository.

      CAVATICA is a data analysis and sharing platform designed to accelerate
      discovery in a scalable, cloud-based compute environment where data,
      results, and workflows are shared among the world's research community.
      CAVATICA and its partners continuously seek to find ways to collaborate,
      share, interoperate, and connect with any and all other data platforms in
      order to empower data across diseases, ages and geography supporting
      researchers and patients across the United States and throughout the
      world. 


      The portal integrates with CAVATICA via mechanisms to approve access and
      push genomic files of interest from the Portal to Cavatica. Here,
      researchers and bioinformaticians can create their own or use existing
      workflows to further analyze the datasets.

      Gen3 is an open source [Data Commons framework](https://gen3.org/)
      supporting a number of large-scale NIH- and non-NIH Commons including the
      NCI’s Genomic Data Commons, NHLBI’s Data Stage, the NIH Data Commons
      Pilot, Bionimbus, and the BloodPAC Data Commons.  As such, Gen3 services
      and APIs support the Kids First Data Resource Center by providing digital
      object services, authentication, and authorization that allow
      interoperability between existing and future data commons that use the
      same standards. By using Gen3, the DRC provides the ability for users to
      connect and integrate their eRA commons accounts via the Portal. This
      allows secure and seamless access to the datasets via all components of
      the DRC. For example, Cavatica also utilizes the user’s Gen3 integration
      to ensure user’s are only performing workflows and analysis on their
      authorized data.


      In the portal, users can connect & integrate their eRA commons accounts
      with Gen3. Doing so will allow the Portal to authenticate and authorize
      the user to access only datasets for which they have been granted access
      by dbGaP. This helps ensure controlled access data is kept secure.
      Cavatica also utilizes the user’s Gen3 integration to ensure user’s are
      only performing workflows and analysis on their authorized data.
