  The Kids First DRC Portal will integrate with existing platforms starting with Cavatica. Future integrations are planned for later releases of the Portal.
  

  CAVATICA is a data analysis and sharing platform designed to accelerate discovery in a scalable, cloud-based compute environment where data, results, and workflows are shared among the world's research community. CAVATICA and its partners continuously seek to find ways to collaborate, share, interoperate, and connect with any and all other data platforms in order to empower data across diseases, ages and geography supporting researchers and patients across the United States and throughout the world. 

  
  The portal integrates with CAVATICA via mechanisms to approve access and push genomic files of interest from the Portal to Cavatica. Here, researchers and bioinformaticians can create their own or use existing workflows to further analyze the datasets.
